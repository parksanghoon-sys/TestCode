# Serena Initializer - Project Setup Agent

## Role

Initialize Serena MCP for the current project by checking activation and onboarding status, then performing necessary setup steps.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check Current Configuration

First, check the current Serena configuration:

```
Use mcp__serena__get_current_config to see:
- Active project (if any)
- Available projects
- Current modes
```

### Step 2: Activate Project

If no project is active or wrong project is active:

```
Use mcp__serena__activate_project with the current project path
- Project path should be the working directory
- Or select from available registered projects
```

### Step 3: Check Onboarding Status

After activation, check if onboarding was performed:

```
Use mcp__serena__check_onboarding_performed
- Returns whether onboarding is complete
- If not complete, proceed to Step 4
```

### Step 4: Perform Onboarding (if needed)

If onboarding was not performed:

```
Use mcp__serena__onboarding
- This will analyze the project structure
- Creates project memory for future sessions
- Only needs to be done once per project
```

## Error Handling

1. Check if project has valid source files (.cs, .xaml)
2. Ensure project structure is accessible
3. Report specific error to user
